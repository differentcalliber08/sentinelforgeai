# SentinelForgeAI: AI-Native Design Infrastructure for India‚Äôs Semiconductor Ecosystem

## Abstract

SentinelForgeAI is an AI-powered platform designed to support India‚Äôs semiconductor ecosystem by enabling intelligent RTL code generation, verification, and policy simulation workflows. By combining large language models (LLMs), open-source EDA tools, and real-time infrastructure simulation, the platform aims to democratize chip design while enhancing security and verification standards. This paper presents the motivation, architecture, and early implementation of SentinelForgeAI as a foundational step toward India‚Äôs self-reliant silicon innovation roadmap.

## Introduction

India‚Äôs growing ambitions in semiconductor manufacturing and electronics innovation have created an urgent need for accessible, intelligent design infrastructure. Despite government initiatives and increasing interest in local chip production, the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) ecosystem remains fragmented, costly, and heavily dependent on proprietary tools and expert-driven workflows. This presents a significant barrier for startups, universities, and early-stage designers to contribute to semiconductor R&D effectively.

At the same time, breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) and open-source EDA tooling present a unique opportunity to reshape the RTL design and verification process. Inspired by state-of-the-art research in LLM-assisted EDA ‚Äî such as AIVRIL and LLM4EDA ‚Äî SentinelForgeAI proposes a cloud-native, AI-powered automation system for Verilog code generation, simulation, and verification. 

The platform is designed to help democratize access to semiconductor design flows by reducing the complexity, tooling overhead, and human error typically associated with RTL workflows. Through multi-agent AI loops that can generate and refine RTL code from natural language prompts, SentinelForgeAI aims to build the foundational infrastructure that enables India's chip design sector to become self-reliant, agile, and innovation-ready.

## Related Work

Recent advancements in the application of large language models (LLMs) to Electronic Design Automation (EDA) have laid the groundwork for intelligent, semi-autonomous chip design flows. Notable among these is **AIVRIL** (AI-Driven RTL Generation With Verification-in-the-Loop), which introduces a feedback-driven Verilog generation system using GPT-style models and syntax verification through open-source tools like Yosys. AIVRIL‚Äôs core innovation lies in its iterative refinement of RTL code using error messages from synthesis tools to guide code corrections. This concept forms the technical backbone of SentinelForgeAI‚Äôs code-review agent loop.

Another key development is **LLM4EDA**, a survey of the emerging ecosystem where LLMs assist in EDA flows ranging from synthesis to simulation and debugging. It outlines different architectural approaches ‚Äî including single-agent assistants, chat-based debugging flows, and agent-based orchestration ‚Äî many of which serve as inspiration for SentinelForgeAI‚Äôs multi-agent approach. Unlike LLM4EDA‚Äôs general exploration, SentinelForgeAI aims to deliver a focused SaaS platform that connects prompt-to-code-to-simulation in a minimal and usable loop.

While several proprietary tools (e.g., Synopsys DSO.ai, Cadence Cerebrus) explore AI-powered EDA optimization, their closed-source nature and high barrier to entry leave a wide gap for open, accessible, and India-first infrastructure. SentinelForgeAI occupies this space by marrying open-source EDA tools with LLMs in a looped, API-ready architecture ‚Äî empowering early-stage teams to move fast with verifiable, AI-assisted hardware design.
## System Architecture

SentinelForgeAI is built on a modular, multi-agent AI framework that replicates core RTL development workflows using language models and open-source EDA tools. The goal is to reduce the manual bottlenecks of Verilog generation, syntax debugging, simulation, and design refinement ‚Äî especially for first-time or early-stage semiconductor engineers.

At its core, the platform is structured around three intelligent agents operating in a feedback loop:

---

### 1. Code Generation Agent (LLM)

- **Function**: Converts natural language prompts into Verilog RTL modules.
- **Model**: GPT-3.5 or 4-Turbo via OpenAI API (or open-source fallback like CodeLlama via Hugging Face).
- **Prompt Engineering**: Custom templates trained on HDL syntax expectations and design structure.
- **Output**: A candidate `top.v` Verilog file.

---

### 2. Simulation & Syntax Validation Agent (Yosys Wrapper)

- **Function**: Automatically runs synthesis/simulation via [Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys).
- **Input**: The Verilog file generated by the LLM.
- **Validation**:
  - Parses Yosys logs for syntax errors, warnings, and unsupported modules.
  - Classifies issues into fixable categories (missing ports, wrong module syntax, etc.)

---

### 3. Review & Refinement Agent (LLM-Based)

- **Function**: Reads error messages and logs from Yosys, and suggests fixes to the original code.
- **Loop Logic**:
  - Takes failed logs and contextually re-prompts the Code Agent to refine its output.
  - Can iterate multiple times until a ‚Äúpass‚Äù is returned from simulation.

### Additional Components

| Component         | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Frontend UI**  | Web prompt input (future phase) |
| **Cloud Orchestration** | Netlify for frontend, GitHub Actions or local Flask server for inference |
| **API Key Vault** | OpenAI key management via `.env` |
| **Export Module** | Verified RTL saved to repo, optionally passed to Verilator for logic simulation (Phase 2) |

## Implementation Details

The initial implementation of SentinelForgeAI is structured as a modular, open-source MVP using Python, shell scripts, and standard EDA tools. The system is broken into logical directories, each representing a key component of the Code‚ÄìSimulate‚ÄìFix loop.

## Conclusion

SentinelForgeAI represents a pragmatic leap forward in democratizing semiconductor design and verification through intelligent automation. By blending large language models, open-source EDA tooling, and feedback-driven refinement loops, the platform offers an accessible on-ramp for startups, researchers, and students to contribute to India‚Äôs silicon innovation journey.

What begins as a lightweight prototype ‚Äî transforming natural language into verifiable RTL ‚Äî lays the foundation for a scalable, cloud-native design assistant. As the platform evolves, integration with simulation engines, testbench generation, coverage analysis, and FPGA support will enable full-stack design-to-deploy workflows previously gated behind proprietary toolchains and high expertise barriers.

In a world where software has been democratized through frameworks and APIs, SentinelForgeAI aims to do the same for silicon ‚Äî by turning chip design into a programmatic, iterative, and AI-assisted process. This work marks the beginning of a new paradigm: infrastructure-aware, security-conscious, India-first chip development, made possible by the convergence of open source, cloud computing, and large-scale generative intelligence.
