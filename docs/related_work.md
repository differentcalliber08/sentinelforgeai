Recent advancements in the application of large language models (LLMs) to Electronic Design Automation (EDA) have laid the groundwork for intelligent, semi-autonomous chip design flows. Notable among these is **AIVRIL** (AI-Driven RTL Generation With Verification-in-the-Loop), which introduces a feedback-driven Verilog generation system using GPT-style models and syntax verification through open-source tools like Yosys. AIVRIL’s core innovation lies in its iterative refinement of RTL code using error messages from synthesis tools to guide code corrections. This concept forms the technical backbone of SentinelForgeAI’s code-review agent loop.

Another key development is **LLM4EDA**, a survey of the emerging ecosystem where LLMs assist in EDA flows ranging from synthesis to simulation and debugging. It outlines different architectural approaches — including single-agent assistants, chat-based debugging flows, and agent-based orchestration — many of which serve as inspiration for SentinelForgeAI’s multi-agent approach. Unlike LLM4EDA’s general exploration, SentinelForgeAI aims to deliver a focused SaaS platform that connects prompt-to-code-to-simulation in a minimal and usable loop.

While several proprietary tools (e.g., Synopsys DSO.ai, Cadence Cerebrus) explore AI-powered EDA optimization, their closed-source nature and high barrier to entry leave a wide gap for open, accessible, and India-first infrastructure. SentinelForgeAI occupies this space by marrying open-source EDA tools with LLMs in a looped, API-ready architecture — empowering early-stage teams to move fast with verifiable, AI-assisted hardware design.
